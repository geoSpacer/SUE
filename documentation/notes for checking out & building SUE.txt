Notes for checking out SUE from CVS repository
----------------------------------------------

Installed TortoiseCVS client.
Available from http://www.tortoisecvs.org/

Establish the directory (folder) which will be the top-level
of the build dir structure.  For the rest of these instructions, this
root folder of the build dir structure will be referred to as
{build-dir}.

Create folder {build-dir}/libs/
Create folder {build-dir}/libs/common

While viewing {build-dir}/libs/ in Windows Explorer, right-click common,
and select CVS checkout

CVSROOT:
  :pserver:anonymous@sequoia.fsl.orst.edu:/www/htdocs/cvs/repository

  Options tab - checkout dialog
   use custom folder name "2.0"

  Module: libs/common  (this is a path, there are no module names setup for libraries at this time)

  Revision: branch tag: "v2-0_develop"
  use most recent files

This will checkout version 2.0 of the common library into the folder
{build-dir}/libs/common/2.0/

Go to that folder, and open the Visual C++ project file "common_lib.dsp".
There are 4 configurations:
    Win32 - Release
    Win32 - Debug
    Win32 - Release_MD
    Win32 - Debug_MD
The configurations that end in "_MD" are multi-threaded, dynamically-
linked.  The other 2 configurations are simply statically linked.  Build
those two.
  Build -> Set Active Configuration ...
  Build -> Build common.lib

To install library
------------------

libraries are installed in subfolders of {build-dir}/libs/ based on the
configuration names:

  {build-dir}/libs/Release
  {build-dir}/libs/Debug

Include files are installed in {build-dir}/libs/include/{library}/{version #}/{library}
So for example, the headers for library named "libFoo" version 3.1 are installed in:

  {build-dir}/libs/include/libFoo/3.1/libFoo/

In FileView tab in VC++, common_lib files -> source code -> miscellaneous. -> lib_info.cpp
has version number; for these instructions it was version 2.0 release candidate 1.

Copy the library from the configuration directory (Release/ or Debug/) into the
corresponding installation directory, adding the version # to the file name:
So
  {build-dir}/libs/common/2.0/Release/common.lib 
    copied to
  {build-dir}/libs/Release/common_2.0-rc1.lib

  beta release would be {library}_#.#-b#.lib
  official release would be {library}_#.#

INSTALL HEADER FILES
  Copy all *.h and *.inl files from {build-dir}/lib/common/2.0/include/
    exclude _sample.h
  Into {build-dir}/libs/include/common/2.0/common/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create the folder {build-dir}/apps/SUE
Checkout SUE code:

  Right click SUE folder
  CVS Checkout:
    Module: "SUE"
    Revision: Use HEAD branch
    Options: Custom folder name: "1.0"

Select active configuration as Release
and build.

Need to install Parser Generator software from Bumble-Bee software
http://www.bumblebeesoftware.com/index.htm
The project settings for SUE have an absolute path, and assume that Parser Generator
is installed in "C:\Program Files\Parser Generator 2\" which is the default location.
